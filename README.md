# 🌾 Smart Crop Disease Detection System (Geo-Tagged)

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Crop Disease Detection System** is an AI-powered web application designed to identify crop diseases using image classification and provide location-based insights using geo-tagging.

This system helps farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts detect plant diseases early and take preventive actions, improving crop yield and reducing losses.
